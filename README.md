# Palette Swap
A Rails API + JavaScript SPA for generating pure css site backgrounds with adjustable and saveable colour palettes.

## Setup
Clone this repo locally, and navigate to the `palette-swap-backend` folder in your terminal. Once there, run `bundle` as well as `rake db:create`, `rake db:migrate`, `rake db:seed`, and then finally `rails s` to get the server for the database running.

To use the application, navigate to the `palette-swap-frontend` folder and open the `index.html` file with your preferred browser. This app is not responsive at this time, and will look best on screen sizes tablet and larger.

## Credit
